- Rust uses snake case filename convention
- `d` for creating a directory
- `%` for creating a new file
- To run a file:
```bash
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```
- How do I render markdown with current Neovim setup?
- The `main` function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
- `rustfmt` can be used as an autoformatter (more on `rustfmt` in [Appendex D](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html))
- To call a macro called `launch_rocket`, use `!` after the macro name, e.g., `launch_rocket!()`
- Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab
- TODO: Convert tabs to 4 spaces in Neovim 
- Am I currently using tabs or spaces in VS Code?
- Is there a difference between a *ahead-of-time compiled* language and a *compiled* language?
